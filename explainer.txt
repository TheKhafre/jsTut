Using Equality Operator in JS

When we use double equal sign (==) in javascript, it does something called auto-conversion which converts the two objects to the same datatype and then compares them. However, this is not a really good thing in all cases. Here is an example to illustrate this point:
    suppose we have two values 5 and '5.00', logically, this two objects are not the same as one is a string while the other is a number. But, when we compare then using double equals to, it will return "true" because it converts the two to the same type and then see if the values are the same.

To remedy this kind of problem in javascript, that is why we use the triple equals to (===) operator to prevent auto conversion.
